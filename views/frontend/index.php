			The Zawadi Africa Educational Fund is a leadership development program that provides university scholarships, leadership development and life-skills training for academically gifted but financially disadvantaged African girls, with the objective of developing a pipeline of young African women leaders. Zawadi Africa works by securing scholarships at top colleges and universities around the world, and during the girls tenure in college, developing the girls leadership skills and life skills. The Zawadi Africa Education Fund was founded in 2002 by Dr. Susan Mboya - Kidero, and is inspired by the highly-successful Kennedy/Mboya Student Airlifts Program of the 1960's, pioneered by Tom Mboya, and President John F. Kennedy.

			The Zawadi Africa Educational Fund has delivered impressive results in its first 14 years. Zawadi Africa has given out scholarships valued at over $70 million since its inception in 2002. The program has provided full scholarships to over 350 students at 70 colleges and universities in the US, Canada, Kenya, Ghana, Uganda and South Africa, with 145 graduates as of May 2016. Zawadi Africa girls are returning home to take up jobs at top companies including Commercial Bank of Africa, IBM and LÃ“real for example. More impressively, Zawadi Africa  graduates are already making strong contributions in their communities. To date, Zawadi Africa Scholars have founded over 10 non-profit organizations of their own, reaching over 20,000 beneficiaries in Kenya, with life-skills and after-school programs. By 2020 Zawadi Africa aims to reach over 1,000 girls directly, and over 100,000 secondary beneficiaries. To this end the Zawadi Africa Board has set a fundraising target of USD 1,000,000 (KSh 100,000,000) in 2016 towards this goal.
